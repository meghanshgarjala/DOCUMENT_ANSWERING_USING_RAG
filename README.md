# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application

## Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI architecture that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the generation of contextually accurate and information-rich text. This approach is particularly useful for applications where the model needs to answer domain-specific questions, summarize documents, or provide detailed responses based on external knowledge bases.

This repository demonstrates a RAG-based application, focusing on [describe your specific use case, e.g., question answering, summarization, etc.].

## Key Features
- **Retrieval Module**: Extracts relevant information from a large corpus or knowledge base.
- **Generation Module**: Leverages a generative model (e.g., GPT, BERT-based models) to synthesize responses based on retrieved data.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensures accurate and context-aware responses by integrating retrieval and generation in a unified workflow.

## Applications
1. **Customer Support**: Automating responses to customer queries with precise, knowledge-based answers.
2. **Knowledge Management**: Summarizing or extracting insights from large datasets or documents.
3. **Research Assistance**: Providing quick access to relevant research articles, citations, or summaries.
4. **Content Generation**: Assisting in creating articles, blogs, or other content with factual accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `faiss`, and others listed in `requirements.txt`
- Access to a pre-trained generative model (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face models) and a retriever like FAISS or Elasticsearch

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-repo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Add your knowledge base or corpus in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run the Retriever**:
   ```bash
   python retriever.py
   ```
3. **Run the Generator**:
   ```bash
   python generator.py
   ```
4. **Combine RAG Workflow**:
   ```bash
   python rag_pipeline.py
   ```

### Example
To ask a question using the RAG model:
```bash
python rag_pipeline.py --query "What are the applications of RAG?"
```
